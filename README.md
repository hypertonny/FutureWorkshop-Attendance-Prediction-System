## ❓ The Problem

At **Vijaybhoomi University**, we run **FutureWorkshop** events regularly — bringing in industry professionals, alumni, and domain experts as guest speakers to share real-world knowledge with students across all four schools.

The problem is painfully simple:

> *"We invited a guest speaker who flew in from Bangalore. 80 students registered. 15 showed up. The auditorium was embarrassingly empty."*

When a guest takes time out of their schedule to come speak at our campus, they deserve to see a room full of engaged students — not rows of empty chairs. And when students *do* show up, they deserve a well-organized event, not a chaotic scramble because we overbooked.


- **Embarrassed guests** — speakers who prepared for 100 people but present to 20
- **Missed learning** — if we knew turnout would be low, we could have promoted harder or rescheduled2

With four distinct schools (Technology, Design, Business, Music) running cross-disciplinary workshops on 16 different topics, the attendance pattern isn't random — it's *predictable*. A Data Science talk will pack the room with Tech students but barely draw from Music. An industry speaker on a weekday afternoon during exams? Expect a ghost town.

**This system turns that guesswork into a data-driven prediction.**

---

## 💡 The Solution

A machine learning pipeline that learns from **historical attendance patterns** — which topics draw which schools, how speaker type affects turnout, whether exam season kills attendance — and predicts how many students will *actually* walk through the auditorium doors for a new event.

**For organizers:** Know in advance if you'll get 30 or 130 — plan seating, catering, and promotion accordingly.
**For guest speakers:** Walk into a room that's full, not half-empty. Their time and expertise deserve that respect.

### Vijaybhoomi University — 4 Schools

| School                             | Domain Topics                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🖥️**School of Technology** | Data Science, ML, AI & Deep Learning, Web Dev, Cybersecurity, Cloud Computing |
| 🎨**School of Design**       | UI/UX Design, Design Thinking, Branding & Identity, Creative Coding           |
| 💼**School of Business**     | Entrepreneurship, Digital Marketing, Product Management                       |
| 🎵**School of Music**        | Music Production, Sound Design                                                |

The model captures **school-topic affinity** — e.g., Technology students are more likely to attend a Data Science workshop, while Design students gravitate toward UI/UX events.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/hypertonny/FutureWorkshop-Attendance-Prediction-System.git
cd FutureWorkshop-Attendance-Prediction-System

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Initialize DB + Train models (auto-generates data if CSV is missing)
python main.py

# 5. Launch the dashboard
streamlit run app.py
```

> No CSV file needed — `main.py` auto-generates synthetic data on a fresh clone.
> The dashboard opens at **http://localhost:8501** 🎉

### 📦 Data Source & Synthesis

This project uses **synthetically generated data** — no external download required. The script [`generate_data.py`](generate_data.py) creates realistic workshop attendance records from scratch using probability-based rules that mimic real student behavior at Vijaybhoomi University:

- **500 students** across 4 VBU schools, each with randomized CGPA, club activity, and semester
- **100 workshop events** spanning 16 cross-school topics, with varied speakers, time slots, and modes
- **~8 000 registrations** with attendance determined by 10+ realistic factors (club activity, speaker type, exam proximity, topic popularity, registration timing, etc.)

> On a fresh clone, `python main.py` calls `generate_data.py` automatically if no CSV exists — the repo is fully self-contained.

### Data Generator CLI

```bash
# Generate from scratch with custom params
python generate_data.py --students 300 --events 50 --seed 123

# Regenerate attendance for existing CSV
python generate_data.py --regenerate

# Full help
python generate_data.py --help
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### Feature Engineering Pipeline

Raw data has weak correlations (~0.08). The pipeline creates **5 categories** of derived features:

| Category                          | Examples                                                                     | Why it helps                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⏰**Temporal**              | `semester_week`, `is_weekend`, `month`                                 | Attendance drops late in semester                       |
| 👤**Student History**       | `rolling_attendance`, `streak`, `recent_3_rate`                        | Past behavior predicts future                           |
| 🔥**Event Popularity**      | `topic_popularity`, `speaker_pull`, `dept_engagement`                  | Some topics just hit different                          |
| 🏫**School-Topic Affinity** | `dept_topic_match`                                                         | Tech students → Data Science, Design students → UI/UX |
| 🔗**Interactions**          | `combined_quality_attract`, `exam_pressure`, `registration_commitment` | Combined effects matter                                 |

### Model Training

```
Raw Data → NaN Imputation (median) → SMOTE (if imbalanced)
    → Train XGBoost + Random Forest + Logistic Regression
    → Threshold Sweep (0.10 → 0.60)
    → Compare all 3 by F1 → Save winner
```

- **3 Models**: XGBoost (gradient boosting), Random Forest (bagging), Logistic Regression (linear baseline with StandardScaler)
- **NaN Handling**: Remaining NaN filled with column medians for LR/RF compatibility
- **SMOTE**: Only applied when minority class < 35%
- **Threshold Optimization**: Sweeps 0.10–0.60, picks threshold that maximizes F1
- **5-Fold Cross Validation**: Ensures scores aren't just lucky splits
- **Winner Selection**: Best F1 score wins, all 3 models saved for comparison

### Retraining Pipeline

```bash
python src/retrain.py              # retrain from CSV
python src/retrain.py --from-db    # retrain from database
python src/retrain.py --force      # force deploy regardless
```

The pipeline only promotes a new model if it beats the current one by **≥ 1% F1** — preventing unnecessary swaps from random variance.

| **Logistic Regression (Winner)** | **0.748** | **0.801** | **0.683** |

> F1 is the primary metric — accuracy alone is misleading with imbalanced data.
> Winner is auto-selected by highest F1 score. Results vary by seed.
> Trained on 4 VBU schools with 16 cross-school FutureWorkshop topics.

| **🔍 Performance Audit**    | Monthly                | Accuracy drops below threshold  | Review features + threshold sweep          |
| **🧹 Data Cleanup**         | End of each semester   | Semester ends                   | Archive old data, regenerate baseline      |
| **🚀 Feature Updates**      | As needed              | New data sources (LMS, weather) | Update `feature_engineering.py`, retrain |
| **🛡️ Dependency Updates** | Quarterly              | Security patches / new releases | Update `requirements.txt`, test pipeline |

**Retraining safeguard:** The retrain pipeline only deploys a new model if it beats the current one by **≥ 1 % F1 score**, preventing unnecessary swaps from random variance.
